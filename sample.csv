0,R205AWG8UMOSD6,It will do.,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on September 23, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,6 people found this helpful,"I bought this for school and I just hope I don't burn my house down with it. The cord and brick get very hot. I actually burnt my hand picking it up. Not sure if the touch screen is a thing or not, doesn't seem to be. And the battery life is short and unpredictable. Other than that it's fine. I'm not going to be buying from this store again. The payment process was a mess and shipping kept getting delayed. Then for some reason they sent it from Florida, to New York, only to come back down to Tennessee. Took forever and I needed it for the beginning of school. All in all I'd just have to say don't do it."
1,R2OA7GIJL752HW,Battery died within a few hours,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on November 10, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,One person found this helpful,I was only able to use this laptop for a few hours until the internal battery started shorting and could not be easily replaced. Other laptops let you take their battery out but this company wants to increase electronic waste by forcing you to replace the entire laptop when the battery fails.At least Amazon makes it easy to return :)

I have already it with a longer life battery and is working satisfactorily so far."

7,R2KUWS6GNQLU3N,Great for gaming,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on May 18, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,71 people found this helpful,"Everything about this laptop i like and i am very satisfied, with 8G RAM and 256G ROM my gaming experience is more enjoyable than what it use to be, i still suck at it though...lol. E-mail, facebook, you tube... everything that needs to load or play a video will play and load almost instantly. i dont feel embarrass when doing a presentation because of the little buffering wheel in the scree. I had a 4G RAM AND 64G ROM, it work great never had an issue, it was just old, so i replace it and i wish i would off done it sooner. i need lots of storage but i solve that problem with an external [hard drive] Book. I keep it in my house and as long as it has an internet connection i can access it from anywhere. I strongly recommend itWhen buying a...... Smart Phone,Tablets, Laptop or Desk top, i always look for The RAM, ROM, PROCESSOR and VIDEO/SCREEN QUALITY. For those not familiar or electronic smart, the higher the number the better experience you will have. Lots of people might or might not agree with me. but for those that dont know anything about electronics this will help you a lot. Dont look for the price or the brand unless you care more about Name brands and not performance. Alway try looking for a 6G ROM or better and that will give you an idea. hope this help you a little more."
