E-mail, facebook, you tube... everything that needs to load or play a video will play and load almost instantly. i dont feel embarrass when doing a presentation because of the little buffering wheel in the scree. I had a 4G RAM AND 64G ROM, it work great never had an issue, it was just old, so i replace it and i wish i would off done it sooner. i need lots of storage but i solve that problem with an external [hard drive] Book. I keep it in my house and as long as it has an internet connection i can access it from anywhere. I strongly recommend itWhen buying a...... Smart Phone,Tablets, Laptop or Desk top, i always look for The RAM, ROM, PROCESSOR and VIDEO/SCREEN QUALITY. For those not familiar or electronic smart, the higher the number the better experience you will have. Lots of people might or might not agree with me. but for those that dont know anything about electronics this will help you a lot. Dont look for the price or the brand unless you care more about Name brands and not performance. Alway try looking for a 6G ROM or better and that will give you an idea. hope this help you a little more.'},\n",
